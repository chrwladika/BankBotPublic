# DREAM BANK ChatBot Backend

Welcome to the DREAM BANK ChatBot backend repository! This repository houses the FastAPI backend code for the DREAM BANK ChatBot project developed by [Your Name](https://github.com/chrwladika).

## About the DREAM BANK ChatBot Backend

The DREAM BANK ChatBot backend is built using the FastAPI framework. It provides the server-side logic for processing user requests and communicating with the OpenAI GPT-4 model.

## Getting Started

To run the DREAM BANK ChatBot backend locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/chrwladika/dream-bank-chatbot-backend.git
    cd dream-bank-chatbot-backend
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

    Make sure you have the required Python packages installed. You can typically set up a virtual environment and install the requirements:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the Backend:**

    Start the FastAPI development server:

    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```

    The backend will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Deployment

To deploy the DREAM BANK ChatBot backend, follow these steps:

1. **Install Required Packages:**

    Install any necessary packages for deployment, such as a production-ready ASGI server like `uvicorn`:

    ```bash
    pip install uvicorn
    ```

2. **Run the Backend:**

    Start the FastAPI backend using `uvicorn`:

    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
    ```

    Replace `main` with the name of your backend script containing the FastAPI app instance.

## Integrating OpenAI GPT-4

The DREAM BANK ChatBot backend integrates the OpenAI GPT-4 model to generate text-based responses. The integration is achieved in the `main.py` script using the OpenAI Python library.

To set up your OpenAI API credentials:

1. Sign up for an account on the [OpenAI website](https://beta.openai.com/signup/).
2. Retrieve your API key from your OpenAI dashboard.

In the `main.py` script:

1. Install the OpenAI library:

    ```bash
    pip install openai
    ```

2. Replace `'your-openai-api-key'` with your actual OpenAI API key.

3. Modify the `generate_response` function to use the OpenAI API for generating responses.

For more information on using the OpenAI API, refer to the [OpenAI API documentation](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction).

## Customization

Feel free to customize and extend the DREAM BANK ChatBot backend:

- Modify the API routes and user request handling in the `main.py` file.
- Implement additional features and interactions.
- Integrate with frontend components as needed.
